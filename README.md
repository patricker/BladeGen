- Handle layers: wrap/crisscross/rings/inlays, menuki and rivets
- Pommel variants: orb/disk/spike plus wheel, ring, scent-stopper, crown
- Accessories: optional scabbard builder (throat/locket/chape) with tassel/sword knot controls
- Materials system (MeshPhysicalMaterial) with transmission/emissive/anisotropy controls plus preset Looks
- Render tab: tone mapping, environment presets, outline/bloom/vignette, gradient/wear
- Exports: `.glb` (GLTF), `.obj`, `.stl`, and SVG blueprint
- Built-in historical & fantasy presets with curated material variants (exports via `KHR_materials_variants`)

## In‑App Help

- Micro-tooltips on every control label give a plain‑language summary.
- Click the `?` icon to open a rich popover with details and related links.
- Help Panel: press `Cmd/Ctrl+/` to open; `Cmd/Ctrl+K` to search topics.
- Deep link any topic with `#help=<helpId>` (e.g., `#help=blade.curvature`).
- Explain Mode: press `E` to toggle labels in the viewport; click a label to open help for that part.

### FX modules

Rendering effects and overlays are organized under `src/three/fx` and are UI‑agnostic builders where possible:

- `fx/shaders.ts` — central shader definitions (Fresnel, Flame Aura, Mist, Vignette, Bloom composite, Heat Haze)
- `fx/overlays.ts` — overlay builders (`buildInkOutline`, `buildFresnel`, `buildBladeGradientOverlay`, `buildBladeGradientWearOverlay`)
- `fx/aura.ts` — flame aura mesh builder cloned from the blade geometry
- `fx/embers.ts` — simple GPUPoints embers system
- `fx/innerGlow.ts` — inner glow overlay + shader
- `fx/mist.ts` — mist noise texture, mist builder, and particle update step
- `fx/manager.ts` — orchestrates selective bloom and heat haze passes
- `fx/noise.ts` — value noise texture generator for bump maps

`src/three/setupScene.ts` wires these modules into a working demo and exposes strongly‑typed `renderHooks` for UI components.
